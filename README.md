# ICS32 A1

This is my project for ICS32 Assignment 1. It is a diary program that can create, open, edit, delete, and print notebook files.

## Features

The program supports these commands:

- `C <PATH> -n <DIARY_NAME>`: Create a new notebook
- `D <PATH>`: Delete a notebook
- `O <PATH>`: Open an existing notebook
- `E`: Edit the loaded notebook (change username, password, bio, add/delete diaries)
- `P`: Print the notebook info
- `Q`: Quit the program
